# Drishtikon:
## EdgeAI based human detection system for automated resistive and inductive loads at workspaces <br>
 
+ The beginnings: ***Drishtikon*** is a framework consisting of two modules, the mainboard and the controller modules that can be powered directly from the 220VAC mains in dorms, libraries and canteens. The two boards communicate with each other using a BLE protocol and the mainboard is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi, it connects to the local network using hard coding.<br> <br>
